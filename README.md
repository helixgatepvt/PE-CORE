# PE-CORE

PE-CORE is the canonical capital control and state engine for HelixGate.

It models private-market capital as high-dimensional control-state vectors,
subject to hard constraints, non-commutative events, and time-asymmetric
optionality decay.

This repository:
- DOES NOT provide investment advice
- DOES NOT perform valuation or scoring
- DOES NOT predict outcomes

It surfaces inadmissible capital states, structural constraints,
liquidity horizons, and governance exceptions only.
